## Purpose of the following Commands: 

- `mkdir`: [allows you to create directories]
- `cd`: [change the present working directory]
- `code`: [launch Visual Studio Code]
- `ls`: [view all files within the specified directory]

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Backup and store versions of previous files and directories.
- Access, modify and contribute to a project simultaneously with other people.
- Combine changes made by different people and different branches, resolving errors if it arises.
- Track changes made to files and directories and revert to previous versions if necessary.

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: [Creates a new git repository in the specified destination.]
- `git status`: [Provides the current status on the git repository.]
- `git add`: [Prepares files to be saved to the local git repository.]
- `git commit`: [Saves changes to files in the local git repository.]
- `git push`: [Sends changes from the local repository to the remote repository.]
- `git pull`: [Receives changes made from remote repository and merges them with local repository.]
- `git log`: [Provides a list of all save data in the git repository with their respective descriptions.]
- `git branch`: [Creates a new copy of the repository without affecting the main project repository].
- `git merge`: [Integrates changes made in separate branches of the repository with the main branch and it's changes].
- `git checkout`: [Changes the current branch of the repository currently worked on.]

## My Unique Touch

There are things that set me apart from others:

- I have the will power of 10,000 men.
- I can jump really high.
- I've watched Space Jam over 100 times.
- I have two tuxedo cats.
